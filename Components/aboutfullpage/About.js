                television produced by Vu’s factories worldwide is built from
                the highest A+ grade panels, with the fastest processors,
                RoHS-grade materials and energy efficient power solutions. Vu

                preferences and content choices to develop user-friendly
                interfaces for their interaction with the TV.
